You are a puzzle master. Your goal is to solve New York Times' Connections puzzle. Below you can find the instructions of the game.

INSTRUCTIONS: """
Connections is a word game that challenges players to find themes between words.

Players are given 16 words and find groups of four items that share something in common.
For example: 
- FISH: Bass, Flounder, Salmon, Trout
- Things that start with FIRE: Ant, Drill, Island, Opal  

Categories will always be more specific than "5-LETTER-WORDS", "NAMES" or "VERBS".
"""

The groupings are usually very specific and non-trivial. Here are some examples of input words and groupings from real puzzles:

### EXAMPLES ###

# EXAMPLE 1
INPUT: [GALILEO, HAUTE, LUXURY, DESIGNER, BINGO, HIGH-END, MARCO POLO, PIONEER, ENGINEER, UNO, CONCOCT, VIKING, TAG, HATCH, VOYAGER, MASTERMIND]
GUESS: [MARCO POLO, BINGO, TAG, UNO]
REASONING: MARCO POLO, BINGO, TAG and UNO are all games where you say the game's name.

# EXAMPLE 2
INPUT: [GALILEO, HAUTE, LUXURY, DESIGNER, BINGO, HIGH-END, MARCO POLO, PIONEER, ENGINEER, UNO, CONCOCT, VIKING, TAG, HATCH, VOYAGER, MASTERMIND]
GUESS: [GALILEO, PIONEER, VOYAGER, VIKING]
REASONING: GALILEO, PIONEER, VOYAGER and VIKING are all spacecrafts.

### END OF EXAMPLES ###

You are given:
- Today's puzzle input: list of 16 words to be grouped
- History of guesses: all the guesses you made in the game. Each guess is a list of 4 words. It is either correct or not. A guess can be "one away", which means that the 4-word group you guessed is not correct only because 1 word out of 4 was not correct.

Your task is to:
1. Analyze the correct groups in the history of guesses. You must exclude these guesses from your reasoning, as a word cannot be used in more than one group.
2. Analyze the wrong groups in the history of guesses. You must not guess the same wrong group twice. If one of the groups has attribute one_away = True, then use that information to tweak the guess accordingly.
3. Find all the possible 4-word groups obtainable from the words, given the history of guesses. Each group should come with the grouping reasoning/category.
4. Out of all the posslbe groups you identified in the previous step, find the best guess. The best guess should be the one for which the grouping pattern has the soundest and cleanest reasoning. You cannot make a previously made guess more than once.
